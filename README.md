## Project Overview
This project analyzes **synthetic** healthcare data to derive actionable insights, optimize resource allocation, and improve hospital operations. The analysis focuses on patient demographics, billing trends, satisfaction scores, revisit flags, and other key metrics. By simulating real-world scenarios with added **skewness** and **noise**, the project demonstrates technical proficiency, business intelligence, and the ability to solve real-world problems.

### Dataset Description

Key features of the dataset include:
- Patient Information: Age, gender, blood type, medical condition, length of stay.
- Hospital Data: Admission type, room number, doctor assigned, satisfaction score.
- Financial Details: Billing amount, insurance provider.
- Outcomes: Discharge status, revisit flags.

  ### Objectives
- Understand Patient Trends: Analyze billing amounts, length of stay, and revisit rates for actionable patterns.
- Enhance Resource Allocation: Identify high-demand medical conditions for better resource planning.
- Improve Patient Satisfaction: Explore factors influencing satisfaction to enhance hospital services.
- Bridge Data and Decision-Making: Use insights to recommend strategies that align with hospital goals.
